# Tagging and Resource Groups

* What are Tags? Key Value Pairs assigned to AWS Resources
* Metadata data about data
* Tags can sometimes be inherited

Resource groups make it easy to group your resources using the tags that are assigned to them. You can group resources that share one or more tags

For EC2 - Public and Private IP Addresses
For ELB - Port Configurations
For RDS - What type of DB.


Allows you to run command against resources like in Amazon Systems Manager

Apply automation against fleets with the said Metadata Tags.
Resource Groups in combination with AWS Systems manager is highly powerful.
