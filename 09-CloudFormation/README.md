Examp Tips:

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications.

Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation are both FREE, but not the resources they provision.

CloudFormation can provision almost any AWS service and is completely programmable.
